## task   Rotate Array
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## solved
first attemp was with the simple .pop() and .unshift() an it worked till the test case number 37/38
the problem as I understood is how pop and unshift works so that there is no space for big numbers...

for this task I add scrinshots of few examples of solved that task (for future attemp)

my solution:
